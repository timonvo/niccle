# includes `unstable.build-std = ["core"]` but that's only needed for ESP32-C3 and other chips which
# don't supports atomics instructions and where atomics thus have to be emulated. It doesn't apply
# to ESP32-C6.

# We also don't set a default build target here. Instead we use the `package.default-target` line in
# Cargo.toml to control that.
